        <h1>Welcome to CryptoComplexityAnalyse</h1>
        <p>This project demonstrates an Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) system applied to a static dataset and provides a detailed analysis of its algorithmic complexities.</p>

        <h2>What is Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE)?</h2>
        <p>
            Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a type of public-key cryptography in which the secret key of a user and the ciphertext are dependent upon attributes (e.g., country, department, role). In an ABE system, the decryption of a ciphertext is possible only if the set of attributes of the user key matches the attributes of the ciphertext.
        </p>
        <p>
            ABE schemes are particularly useful for enforcing fine-grained access control on encrypted data, making them suitable for secure data sharing and management in various environments, such as cloud storage or healthcare systems.
        </p>

        <h3>Variants of ABE:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Ciphertext-Policy ABE (CP-ABE):</strong> In CP-ABE, a user's private key is associated with a set of attributes, and a ciphertext is encrypted with an access policy (a logical expression over attributes). A user can decrypt the ciphertext if and only if their attributes satisfy the policy associated with the ciphertext. This scheme allows encryptors to define who can decrypt their data.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Key-Policy ABE (KP-ABE):</strong> In KP-ABE, ciphertexts are encrypted with a set of attributes, and user private keys are associated with an access policy. A user can decrypt a ciphertext if the attributes associated with the ciphertext satisfy the policy associated with their key. This scheme gives the key issuer control over which ciphertexts a user can decrypt.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Importance in Secure Static Data Management</h2>
        <p>
            For static datasets (datasets that do not change frequently), ABE provides a powerful mechanism to encrypt the data once and then manage access by issuing or revoking attribute-based keys. This is more efficient than re-encrypting data for different users or groups, especially in scenarios with many users and complex access rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            By analyzing the complexity of key generation, encryption, and decryption operations, we can better understand the performance implications of using ABE in real-world systems and make informed decisions about its deployment.
